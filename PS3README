The PS3BT.cpp, PS3BT.h, PS3USB.cpp, and PS3USB.h were developed by Kristian Lauszus

For more information regarding the PS3 protocol etc. visit my blog at: http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/ or send me an email at kristianl at tkjelectronics dot dk.
You could also visit the official wiki: https://github.com/TKJElectronics/USB_Host_Shield_2.0/wiki for information.

All three PS3 Controllers are supported (Dualshock 3-, Navigation-, and Motioncontroller). 
They communicate with the Arduino via Bluetooth or USB using the USB Host Shield from http://www.circuitsathome.com/

A special thanks go to the following people:
"Richard Ibbotson" who made this excellent guide: http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/ps3-and-wiimote-game-controllers-on-the-arduino-host-shield-part-1
- It inspired me to get starting and had a lot of good information for the USB communication 
 
"Tomoyuki Tanaka" for releasing his code for the Arduino USB Host shield connected to the wiimote: http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/rc-car-controlled-by-wii-remote-on-arduino
- It helped me a lot to see the structure of the bluetooth communication

Also I would like to thank all the people behind these sites about the Motion controller:

And at last I would like to thank Oleg from http://www.circuitsathome.com/ for making such an awesome shield!
